# Automated-Docker-Security-Scanner
Developed a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically scan Docker images for vulnerabilities using Trivy, generate JSON and PDF reports, and map detected vulnerabilities to NIST Cybersecurity Framework, MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques, and OWASP Top 10 risks. The project demonstrates automated DevSecOps practices and threat assessment reporting.
